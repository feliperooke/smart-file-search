# smart-file-search

Hello, Community!

In this project, weâ€™re going to build an application that provides the best possible experience for uploading and searching for file content. To achieve this goal, we need to think about what it really means to provide an optimized upload experience.

### ðŸš€ Simplified Upload with Drag-and-Drop

The best upload experience is the one that requires the least effort from the user. That's why we chose to implement a drag-and-drop scheme, where you simply drag the file to the application for the upload to be successful.

However, it is essential to consider some important variables:

**File size:** The system must be able to handle small and large files without compromising performance.

**Number of files:** It must be possible to upload multiple files at once, in a practical and intuitive way.

### ðŸ“„ Accepted File Types

To provide a comprehensive experience, we would ideally accept any file type: documents, images, videos, and music. However, to keep our scope realistic and achievable within the timeframe available, we will focus solely on documents.

The formats we will accept include:

- DOC, DOCX (Word)
- XLS, XLSX (Excel)
- PPT, PPTX (PowerPoint)
- TXT (Text)
- PDF (General)

### ðŸ’¡ Future Ideas

While our initial focus is on documents, we may expand this system in the future to process other file types. For example:

Videos: Identify and indicate in which specific passage a certain dialogue or word is spoken.

Music: Find the exact minute a word or phrase appears in the lyrics.

For now, we will keep the scope well defined to ensure efficient and high-quality development. We can't wait to see what we build together! ðŸš€
